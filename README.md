# IDEAS.md

A float-to-the-top ideas log built with [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux), among others.

## Features

* Keep general idea notes and idea notes in named sections.
* Each time a section is edited, it floats to the top.
* Persists to `localStorage`.
* Export to an `IDEAS.md` file.
* Import an `.md` file in the correct format by dropping it on the app.

### [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) integration

* Ideas can be synced with a GitHub Gist containing an `IDEAS.md` file.
* Ideas can be saved to an existing Gist if you generate a personal access token.
